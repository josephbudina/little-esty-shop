## Background and Description
"Little Esty Shop" is a group project that requires students to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices. We approached this project with four people for which we delegated tasks equally between all four of us. Katy La Tour and Jesus Quezada-Guillen took on the merchant side of the platform and Jeremiah Michlitsch and Joseph Budina took on the admin portion of the platform. A large focus of this project was to demonstrate the functionality built by many to many relationships within a relational database. Among these relationships lives several different tables titled Merchants, Items, Invoice Items, Invoices, Transactions, and Customers.

## Learning Goals
- Practice designing a normalized database schema and defining model relationships
- Utilize advanced routing techniques including namespacing to organize and group like functionality together.
- Utilize advanced active record techniques to perform complex database queries
- Practice consuming a public API while utilizing POROs as a way to apply OOP principles to organize code

## Project Overview
### Welcome Page
-When visiting our application welcome page, it does not have direct links to direct you to the admin or the merchant. In the future, we would like to add these to make it more user friendly and could allow for authentication for logins for an admin or a specific merchant user.

### Dashboards
-Merchant Dashboard
Provides Links to Merchant's Items and Invoices to see further statistics on each object the merchant has.
It will show the items that are ready to be shipped and in order by least recent (oldest to newest)
Will also display a Merchant's Top Five Customers and the Total Purchases for each Customer  
-Admin Dashboard
To get to Admin Dashboard, you need to visit ```localhost:3000/admin```
It will show the invoices that are Incomplete

Also provides links to a Index with all the Merchants and an Index with all Invoices
